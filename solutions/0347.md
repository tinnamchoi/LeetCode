# [C++ solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/solutions/3283243/c-solution/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
* Using a hashmap to count the number of occurance for each number, we can achieve linear time

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
* How do we find the top k frequencies?
    * By putting the {val, key} into a max heap
    * then taking the top for k times

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(m + n \log{n})$ where $m$ is the number of elements in the array and $n$ is the number of unique elements in the array
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $O(2n)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // using a hashmap to count the occurance of each number
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        // iterate through the vector and update the hashmap
        for (int const & i : nums) {
            umap[i]++;
        }

        // using a max heap to find the highest count
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
        for (auto const & i : umap) {
            // using the count as the first element in the pair
            pq.push({i.second, i.first});
        }

        vector<int> ans;
        // get the k front elements in the queue and put the second element of each pair in the answer
        while (k--) {
            ans.push_back(pq.top().second);
            pq.pop();
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
